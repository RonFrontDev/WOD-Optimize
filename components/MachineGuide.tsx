                    <p><strong>Seat Position (Forward/Back):</strong> Set the horizontal position so that when the pedals are level, your front kneecap is roughly over the ball of your foot. This ensures an efficient pedaling position.</p>

                        <p><strong>Monitor Focus:</strong> RPM. Pick a number and lock it in. For men, 60-68 RPM is a common target. For women, 50-58 RPM. Stare at that number and do not deviate.</p>

                        <p><strong>Monitor Focus:</strong> RPM. Choose a lower, more conservative number (e.g., Men: 52-58 RPM, Women: 45-52 RPM) that you know you can hold without your heart rate redlining.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fault: Slouching posture.</strong><br/><em>Fix:</em> Sit up tall and keep your chest proud. This opens your diaphragm for more efficient breathing, which is crucial on the bike.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fault: Ignoring the push-pull of the arms.</strong><br/><em>Fix:</em> Don't just let your arms go for a ride. Actively push with one and pull with the other. This contributes significant power to your total output.</p>

                    <p><strong>Damper Setting:</strong> The damper is not resistance; it's gearing. A setting of 3-5 is ideal for most CrossFit workouts, simulating a sleek, fast boat. Higher settings (6-8) are for pure strength work and can burn out your legs quickly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Foot Straps:</strong> Adjust the footbeds so the strap crosses over the widest part of your foot (the ball of your foot). This allows for a powerful leg drive and a flexible heel.</p>

                     <p><strong>SPM (Strokes Per Minute):</strong> Your cadence. It's important, but it's not everything. A high SPM with no power is "spinning your wheels."</p>

                        <p><strong>Monitor Focus:</strong> Pace/500m. Aim for the lowest split you can hold. SPM will be high (32-40+).</p>

                        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> This is where the 1:2 Drive-to-Recovery ratio is king. Focus on a powerful 1-second drive, and a patient 2-second recovery (Arms â†’ Hips â†’ Knees). Breathe out on the drive, in on the recovery.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monitor Focus:</strong> Pace/500m. Pick your goal pace and do not deviate by more than 1-2 seconds. SPM should be steady at 26-30.</p>

                        <p><strong>Monitor Focus:</strong> Pace/500m and SPM. Settle into a lower SPM (22-26) and a conservative pace. Aim to "negative split" (make the second half faster than the first).</p>

                    <p><strong>Fault: Opening the back too early.</strong><br/><em>Fix:</em> This is a sequence error. The power is LEGS, then BACK, then ARMS. Think of it as a deadlift into a row. Don't blend them.</p>

                        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Less aggressive hip hinge and more focus on a smooth, continuous motion. Maintain a strong, flat back to protect your spine. Use the recovery to get a full breath.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monitor Focus:</strong> Pace/500m and SPM. Lower your SPM to 35-42 to conserve energy. Pick a conservative pace you can hold and aim to negative split.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fault: Pulling only with the arms.</strong><br/><em>Fix:</em> This is a full-body movement. The power comes from your hips and core crunching down. Your arms are just connecting your bodyweight to the handles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fault: Bending arms too early.</strong><br/><em>Fix:</em> Keep your arms relatively straight at the top of the pull. The power is in the hinge, not an arm pull-down. Let your bodyweight do the work.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fault: Hunching over at the bottom.</strong><br/><em>Fix:</em> Maintain a strong, flat back throughout the stroke. Hinge at your hips; don't round your spine. This is safer and more powerful.</p>
